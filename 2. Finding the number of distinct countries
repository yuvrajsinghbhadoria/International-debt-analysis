/* From the first ten rows, we can see the amount of debt owed by Afghanistan in the different debt indicators. 
But we do not know the number of different countries we have on the table.
There are repetitions in the country names because a country is most likely to have debt in more than one debt indicator.

Without a count of unique countries, we will not be able to perform our statistical analyses holistically. 
In this section, we are going to extract the number of unique countries present in the table. */
