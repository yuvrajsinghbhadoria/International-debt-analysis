/* As we saw in the first section, there is a column called indicator_name that briefly specifies the purpose of taking the debt. 
Just beside that column, there is another column called indicator_code which symbolises the category of these debts.

Knowing about these various debt indicators will help us to understand the areas in which a country can possibly be indebted to. */
