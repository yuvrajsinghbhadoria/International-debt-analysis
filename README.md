# International-Debt-Statistics-Analysis-SQL

Just like citizens go to a bank if they need money to grow economically, countries also approach the World Bank for loans to support development in their countries.

This project aims to analyze international debt data collected by the World Bank using sql and provide insights into global debt trends over time.

# Data Sources

The data used in this project was obtained from the World Bank's international debt statistics database, which can be accessed here: https://www.worldbank.org/en/home

The data covers a range of debt indicators including debt-to-GDP ratios, debt service ratios, and external debt stocks and flows. The data is available in multiple formats including CSV and Excel, and can be downloaded directly from the World Bank website.
